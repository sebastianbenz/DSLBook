\subsection{Language Reuse} 

Language reuse (\fig{langReuse}) enables \emph{homogenous} fragments with
\emph{independent} languages. Given are two independent languages $l_2$ and
$l_1$ and two fragment $f_2$ and $f_1$. $f_2$ depends on $f_1$, so that
\begin{align}
\exists r \in \mathit{Refs_{f_2}} \mid \; &\mathit{fo(r.from)} = 
		f_2\; \wedge \nonumber \\ 
	&\mathit{fo(r.to)} = (f_1 \vee f_2)
\end{align}
\marginnote[-7mm]{One could argue that in this case reuse is just a clever
combination of referencing and extension. While this is true from an implementation
perspective, it is worth describing as a separate approach, because it enables
the combination of two \emph{independent languages} by adding an adapter
\emph{after the fact}, so no pre-planning during the design of $l_1$ and $l_2$
is necessary.}
Since $l_2$ is independent, it cannot directly reference concepts in $l_1$. This
makes $l_2$ reusable with different languages (in contrast to language
referencing, where concepts in $l_2$ reference concepts in $l_1$). We call $l_2$
the \emph{context} language and $l_1$ the \emph{reused} language.




One way of realizing dependent fragments while retaining independent languages
is using an adapter language $l_A$ where $l_A$ \emph{extends} $l_2$ and
\begin{align}
\exists r \in \mathit{Refs_{l_A}} \mid \mathit{lo(r.from)} =
l_A\; \wedge \;\mathit{lo(r.to)} = l_1
\end{align}

  \caption{Reuse: $l_1$ and $l_2$ are independent languages. Within
  an $l_2$ fragment, we still want to be able to reference concepts in another
  fragment expressed with $l_1$. To do this, an adapter language $l_A$ is
  added that depends on both $l_1$ and $l_2$, using inheritance and
  referencing to adapt $l_1$ to $l_2$.}

While language referencing supports reuse of the referenced language, language
reuse supports the reuse of the \emph{referencing} language as well. This makes
sense for concern DSLs that have the potential to be reused in many domains,
with minor adjustments. Examples include role-based access control, relational
database mappings and UI specification.    

\genex{Consider a language for describing user interfaces. It provides language
concepts for various widgets, layout definition and disable/enable strategies.
It also supports data binding, where data structures are associated with
widgets, to enable two-way synchronization between the UI and the data. Using
language reuse, the same UI language can be used with \emph{different} data
description languages. Referencing would not achieve this goal because the UI
language would have a direct dependency on a particular data description
language. Changing the dependency direction to $data \rightarrow ui$ doesn't
solve the problem either, because this would go against the generally accepted
idiom that UI has dependencies to the data, but not vice versa (cf. the MVC
pattern).}

Generally, the referencing language is built with the knowledge that it will be
reused with other languages, so hooks may be provided for adapter languages
to plug in. 

\genex{The UI language thus may define an abstract concept
\lcr{DataMapping} which is then extended by various adapter languages.}
